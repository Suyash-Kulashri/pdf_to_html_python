# **ARTESYN LCM300**

## 300 Watts Bulk Front End

Advanced Energy’s Artesyn LCM300 series provide for a very **AT A GLANCE**

wide range of AC-DC embedded power requirement. Featuring


high build quality with robust screw terminals, long life, and



typical full-load efficiency of greater than 91 percent, these units


are ideal for use in industrial and medical applications. They are


backed by a comprehensive set of industrial and medical safety


approvals and certificates. Variable-speed ‘Smart Fans’ draw


on software controls developed by Advanced Energy to match


fan speed to the unit’s cooling requirement and load current.


Slowing the fan not only saves power but also reduces wear,


thus extending its life.

2 provided are clearly visible up to a 45 degree offset from vertical with office environment ambient lighting. The status is reflected in the indicator color.


**The DC_OK LED** LED shall light green if the DC output is within specification, and should be off if the output falls out of specification.


**The AC_OK LED** LED is green if the AC is within specification and off when out of specification. Note: With 5 V standby, Green also indicates that

PSU is in standby mode/output off.


**CONTROL SIGNALS**

**AC_OK** Open collector 0.5 V maximum at 10 mA. Both emitter and collector access provided.
**DC_OK** Open collector 0.5 V maximum at 10 mA. Both emitter and collector access provided.


DC_OK will de-assert when output is loss due to OCP, OVP, OTP, or Fan Fault (for -N option).
